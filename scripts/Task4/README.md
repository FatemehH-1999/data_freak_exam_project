# data_freak_exam_project
This project is part of the RMED901 course, and the answers were prepared by the Data Freak exam project group.
#Task4
#Goal
Create plots that would help answer these questions

##Fatemeh
###Does the distribution of the ct_result differ with sex group?
####Boxplot: compares medians & spread
The boxplot shows that the distribution of ct_result is very similar for females and males, with no obvious difference between the two sex group
####Violin plot: shows full distribution shape
The violin plot indicates that the ct_result distributions for females and males are nearly identical, showing no meaningful difference between the two sex groups
###Density plot: both groups overlaid
The density plot shows that the ct_result distributions for females and males almost completely overlap, indicating no noticeable difference between the two gender groups

##Pratik
###Does the time spent waiting for the test result improve during these 100 days that the dataset includes?
####point plot
need to find correlation between rec_ver_tat and pan_day
No improvement found and the correlation matrix shows almost no correlation (r=0.01)
###Were there more females than males that took the test at a drive through?
####bar plot
Yes, there were more females (n=4035) than males (n=3952)
