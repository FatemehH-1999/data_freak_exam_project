###Is there a difference in the distributions of ct_results between different outcome groups (result)
Yes, ct_result values are lower in positive cases and higher in negative ones, with no data for the invalid group.

##Pratik
###Are there more positive tests in the drive-through?
Yes, there are more positive tests in the drive-through group both by count (479 versus 386) and proportion (3.1% versus 2.5%)

##Sebastian
###Is the age of the individual associated with whether the test result is negative or positive?
Yes, in general: the younger the person, the more likely it is for the result to be negative.
50 % of individuals age 10 or younger have negative results. Second most distribution (ca. 25 %) age 10 - ~23. Median at age 10.
50 % of individuals age 20 or younger have positive results. Second most distribution (ca. 25 %) age 20 - ~27. Median at age 20.
Individuals with negative results are approx. 10 years younger than individuals with positive result.
